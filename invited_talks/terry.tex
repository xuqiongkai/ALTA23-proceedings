Is NLP becoming a commodity? In 2023, thanks to a thriving ecosystem of open-source libraries and commercial services, building applied NLP solutions is easier than it ever has been before. The barrier to entry is low, and NLP technology which previously would have required a team of experts is now accessible to a vast audience of data scientists, developers, and enthusiasts. Even the most cutting-edge developments in large language models are readily accessible, and consumers can pick and choose between different models and nearly interchangeable service providers. In my talk, I will share some of my experiences building applied NLP services at SEEK, as well as some of my observations on how the “commoditisation of NLP” has (and has not) impacted the way that these services are currently developed and deployed. I will also offer my perspectives on some broad questions raised by the commoditisation of NLP: What new opportunities are unlocked? What new risks and challenges do we face? And what does this mean for the NLP community and the future of NLP?
