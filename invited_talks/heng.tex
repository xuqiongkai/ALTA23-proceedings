History repeats itself, sometimes in a bad way. Preventing natural or man-made disasters requires being aware of these patterns and taking pre-emptive action to address them. Effective response to emerging events like the COVID pandemic and the Ukraine Crisis require a time-sensitive comprehensive understanding of the situation. Automated generation of situation reports can significantly reduce the time, effort, and cost for domain experts when preparing their official human-curated reports. However, AI research toward this goal has been very limited, and no successful trials have yet been conducted to automate such report generation and “what-if” disaster forecasting. In this talk I present SmartBook, a novel framework that cannot be solved by ChatGPT, to consume large volumes of news data and produce a structured situation report with multiple hypotheses (claims) summarized and grounded with rich links to factual evidence through claim detection, fact checking, misinformation detection and factual error correction. SmartBook can also serve as a novel news event simulator or an intelligent prophetess when given “What-if” conditions and dimensions elicited from a domain expert user concerning a disaster scenario.
